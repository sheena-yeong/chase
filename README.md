## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Vite + TailwindCSS + ReactDnD
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js
- **Database:** Airtable
- **APIs:** Slack API
- **Deployment**: Railway

## Next Steps
- TypeScript: Run program in TypeScript instead
- OAuth: Add OAuth and have individual boards for each user
- Redis caching: Cache frequently accessed data (tasks, users) to reduce Airtable API calls
- Database migration: Move from Airtable to PostgreSQL/MongoDB for more control and scalability
