# About Chase
<img src="./src/assets/chase_logo.png" alt="Chase Logo" width="200" />
Chase is an airhorn with anger issues. Chase honks at everything that moves (and some things that donâ€™t), waddles around like he owns the place, and will hunt people down for simply breathing too loud. He's the guy (or goose) to chase down team members who procrastinate tasks that were due yesteryear.
Leave it to Chase to get your task done, and on time.
